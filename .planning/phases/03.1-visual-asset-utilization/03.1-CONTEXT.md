# Phase 3.1: Visual Asset Utilization - Context

**Gathered:** 2026-02-27
**Status:** Ready for planning

<domain>
## Phase Boundary

Make every on-screen entity visually unambiguous using the craftpix asset library that is currently unused. Player ship is unmistakably "yours", each enemy faction has a distinct look with matching death FX, weapons point in the direction they fire, and all ships have living engine exhaust effects. No new gameplay — pure visual fidelity.

## Implementation Decisions

### Player Ship Identity
- Recolor player ship to **bright white/silver** (currently blue — too close to cyan zigzaggers)
- Apply **subtle tilt/bank (5–15°)** when strafing left or right — feels alive and responsive
- At **below 50% HP**: ship flickers + emits smoke particles from engine area — urgent visual feedback without needing to check the health bar

### Enemy Faction Mapping
Three craftpix ship sets map to enemy types by tier:
- **UFO set** → grunt (disposable fodder, alien silhouette reads as weakest)
- **Pirate set** → zigzagger + diver (agile mid-tier, pirate ships read as scrappy/fast)
- **Enemy set** → formation_leader + bomber (military/heavy ships for the elite tier)

Each type uses the appropriate craftpix `Ship_01–06` sprite. Damaged variant (`Damaged_Ship_XX`) swaps in below 50% HP, same as existing pattern.

Each faction's death explosion uses **its own set's** `Explosion_1/2.png` + fragments — not the shared one. This means grunts (UFO), mid-tier (Pirate), and heavies (Enemy) all die differently.

### Weapon Directionality
- **All projectiles rotate** to match their actual velocity angle — spiral burst bullets, spread shots, aimed shots, all beams — everything points where it goes
- This applies to both player bullets and enemy bullets

### Engine & Shooting FX
- **Constant engine exhaust** on all ships (player + enemies) using craftpix `Exhaust_*.png` sprites positioned at the rear of each ship — always on, not just when accelerating
- **Muzzle flash** on weapon fire — brief flash effect at the gun barrel position
- FX scale proportionally to ship size (elite enemies get slightly larger exhaust)

### Claude's Discretion
- Which specific ship variant number (01–06) maps to each enemy type within its set — pick based on silhouette fit
- Exhaust animation loop speed and alpha
- Exact muzzle flash duration and size
- Tilt interpolation speed (how fast the ship banks and recovers)

</decisions>

<specifics>
## Specific Ideas

- Player as "white/silver hero against dark space" — should feel like the distinct protagonist ship in a classic vertical shooter
- Enemy faction tiers should be readable at a glance: UFO = weak, Pirate = fast, Enemy military = dangerous
- Weapon rotation is the key fix — "if he's attacking to the left, the laser/beam should be rotated to the left, not pointing vertically"
- Engine exhaust is a "nice stuff you're missing" — craftpix has it, use it, make ships feel alive

## Deferred Ideas

- None raised — discussion stayed within phase scope
