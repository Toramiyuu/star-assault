<objective>
Human visual verification of the HUD layout changes delivered by plan 01.1-01. This plan requires a human to load the game, set DevTools to 375px viewport width, and confirm all four ROADMAP success criteria are met for Phase 1.1.

Purpose: All Phase 1.1 acceptance criteria are fundamentally visual — no automated test can validate "legible at a glance." This checkpoint closes the phase with human sign-off before moving to Phase 2.
Output: Human-confirmed pass/fail on each ROADMAP success criterion.

  <name>Task 1: Visual verification at 375px mobile viewport</name>
  <files>none — human verification task, no files modified</files>
  <action>No automated action — this task requires human visual inspection. Run `npm run dev`, open the game at 375px DevTools viewport width, and play through wave 1-3 to confirm all four ROADMAP Phase 1.1 success criteria are met.</action>
  <what-built>
    HUD.js has been fully reworked: shield/HP bars enlarged to 560x30px and repositioned to Y=160/200 (below notch safe zone), XP bar moved to bottom safe zone (Y=1760) at 920px wide, all font sizes increased to 48-52px, emoji icons replaced with text labels, all layout values are named constants, dirty-flag guards prevent unnecessary per-frame redraws.
  </what-built>
  <how-to-verify>
    1. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
    2. Open the game in Chrome/Edge
    3. Open DevTools (F12) → Toggle device toolbar → set width to 375px (iPhone 14 size)
    4. Start a game, play through wave 1 to wave 3

    Check each success criterion:

    **Criterion 1 — Bar readability:**
    Shield bar (blue) and HP bar (red/green) are clearly visible strips — NOT thin lines you have to squint at. Each bar should look like a proper progress bar, similar to Survivor.io's HP bar. Estimated CSS-rendered width: ~194px. If they look too narrow or too thick, note the observation.

    **Criterion 2 — Play area not obscured:**
    During wave combat with multiple enemies on screen, no HUD element sits in the center of the play area. Bars are at top-left, XP bar is at bottom. Enemies and bullets in the center are fully visible.

    **Criterion 3 — XP bar and streak legibility:**
    XP bar is visible near the bottom of the screen as a wide orange-filled strip. Level text ("LV 3") is readable next to/below it. Kill streak counter (top-right, "x5") is readable without zooming.

    **Criterion 4 — Survivor.io-style layout:**
    Large bars anchored top-left. XP bar full-width at bottom. Nothing in screen center. Similar visual hierarchy to Survivor.io (bars prominent, gameplay area clear).

    **Functional checks:**
    - Take damage: shield bar animates (tweens, does not jump)
    - Let shield recharge: bar tweens upward, recharge glow pulses
    - Collect XP orbs: XP bar fills from the left
    - Reach wave 5+ for boss: boss bar appears without overlapping shield/HP bars

    Type "approved" if all four criteria pass, or describe any issues.

Human sign-off on all four ROADMAP Phase 1.1 success criteria.
</verification>

<success_criteria>
Human types "approved" after confirming:
1. Shield/HP bars are readable without squinting at 375px viewport
2. No HUD element obscures the active play area
3. XP bar, kill streak, wave indicator are legible during combat
4. Layout matches Survivor.io-style conventions (large bars at edges, clear center)
