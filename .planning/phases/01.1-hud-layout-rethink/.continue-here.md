Phase 01.1 execution is complete (both plans done, committed) but the checkpoint task (01.1-02) was never formally closed — the user gave feedback mid-checkpoint, we applied fixes, but SUMMARY.md for plan 02 and phase VERIFICATION.md still reflect the intermediate state. The last code commit (81f2ab0) is the CORRECT final state — HUD fully moved to HTML letterbox bars.

The game needs a visual re-test at 375px to confirm the HTML HUD approach works before marking phase 01.1 truly complete.

<completed_work>

## Plan 01.1-01 (DONE — commit 84ce49e + 2750572)
- Extracted 13 layout constants to HUD.js module top
- Resized bars to 560×30px, repositioned to Y=160/200
- Moved XP bar to bottom (Y=1760, 920px wide)
- Added dirty-flag guards to shield/HP fill redraws

## Intermediate fix (DONE — commit 5781aa9)
- User said bars too large, covering gameplay
- Reduced: BAR_W=320, BAR_H=18, SHIELD_Y=80, HEALTH_Y=106
- Slimmed hudBg (Y=0-130) and xpBotGrad (28px height)
- Boss bar to Y=140

## FINAL approach — HTML letterbox HUD (DONE — commit 81f2ab0)
User's key insight: the Phaser.Scale.FIT creates ~68px letterbox bars above/below the canvas at 375×802px viewport. Put the entire HUD in those black bars instead of overlaying the canvas.

**3 files changed:**
- `index.html`: Full rewrite — flexbox layout: #hud-top (56px) + #game-container (flex:1) + #hud-bottom (44px). All HUD is HTML/CSS (SH bar, HP bar, WAVE label, score, streak, XP bar + level). CSS transitions replace Phaser tween proxies. CSS animations for shield recharge pulse and low-HP pulse.
- `src/main.js`: Added `parent: 'game-container'` to scale config so canvas renders inside the flex area.
- `src/systems/HUD.js`: Complete rewrite — DOM-based updates via getElementById. Boss bar stays in-canvas (dynamic, complex). No more Phaser Graphics for HUD. No more per-frame clear()+redraw. Dirty-flag cache (_lastScore, _lastShieldRatio, _lastHealthRatio) to avoid unnecessary DOM writes.

Duplicate wave text also fixed: old HUD had waveText on canvas + WaveManager had its own canvas popup. Now: HTML #wave-text (small persistent label) + WaveManager canvas pop-in (big animated). Two different things, no more visual duplicate.
</completed_work>

<remaining_work>

## Immediate — Visual re-test required
Open http://localhost:5173 at 375px DevTools width and confirm:
1. Top black bar shows SH/HP bars + WAVE N + score/streak
2. Bottom black bar shows LV N + XP bar
3. Game canvas is 100% clean — no HUD overlay at all
4. Shield bar animates (CSS transition) when taking damage
5. Boss fight: boss bar appears in canvas near top (Y=60) without conflict

## Then — Close Phase 01.1 formally
After visual confirm: update STATE.md, run `node ./.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs phase complete "01.1"`, commit.

## Then — Phase 2: Ground Drop Icon System
See ROADMAP.md Phase 2. Next command: `/gsd:plan-phase 2`

## Pending Todo
- Fix crash when picking up MAG drop (GroundDropManager) — see .planning/todos/pending/2026-02-26-crash-when-picking-up-mag-drop.md
</remaining_work>

<decisions_made>

- HUD moved to HTML letterbox bars entirely — canvas is now pure game content, zero overlay
- CSS transitions replace Phaser tween proxy pattern (simpler, no Phaser tween lifecycle)
- CSS @keyframes replace per-frame Math.sin glow pulses (shield recharge pulse, low-HP pulse)
- Boss bar kept in-canvas — it's dynamic (appears/disappears, changes color), easier in Phaser
- Wave: small persistent HTML label + big WaveManager canvas pop-in animation (both kept)
- Duplicate wave text was: two canvas texts (HUD waveText + WaveManager popup). Fixed by moving HUD waveText to HTML.
</decisions_made>

<blockers>
- None technical. Game needs visual re-test to confirm HTML HUD renders correctly.
</blockers>

<context>
The core insight driving this session: Phaser.Scale.FIT at 375×802 viewport creates letterbox black bars (~68px top/bottom) because the 1080×1920 canvas only renders to 375×667px. The user spotted this and correctly identified that ALL HUD elements should live in those black bars, keeping the entire canvas for gameplay.

The approach is cleaner than canvas HUD:
- No per-frame Graphics.clear() in hot path
- CSS transitions handle bar animations natively
- No Phaser tween lifecycle management
- HUD is always readable regardless of game background color
- Scales correctly on any viewport height (CSS flexbox handles it)

Key files:
- index.html — the entire HUD layout
- src/systems/HUD.js — DOM update methods (setWave, updateXPBar, updateStreak, update, showBossHP)
- src/main.js — parent: 'game-container' routes canvas into the flex container
</context>

<next_action>
1. `/clear` to get fresh context
2. Open http://localhost:5173 at 375px DevTools width
3. Visually confirm HTML letterbox HUD works (bars in black areas, canvas clean)
4. If OK: run `node ./.claude/get-shit-done/bin/gsd-tools.cjs phase complete "01.1"` to close phase
5. Then `/gsd:plan-phase 2` for Ground Drop Icon System
</next_action>
